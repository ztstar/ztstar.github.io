[Problem A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2135/A)

This is an easy 1D DP problem. ~ Leetcode Difficulty. 

[Problem B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2135/B)

An interactive problem. 

No idea for it when I first see it. 

[Problem C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2135/B)

Keyword: Graph, xor, path, counting. 

You need to discover the property of the graph to satisfy the condition. After that, it's almost template for finding Edge Biconnectted Component (边双连通分量). 

Some knowledge that are similar to each other: Strongly Connected Component (SCC, 强连通分量), Edge Biconnected Component(边双连通分量), Vertex Biconnected Component(点双连通分量). 

[Problem D2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2135/D2)

another interacitve problem. 

[Problem E2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2135/E2)

not sure if I'm going to do this for my current training?
