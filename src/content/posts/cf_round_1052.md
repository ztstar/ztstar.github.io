I only did D2 and E of this contest. They are both very good problems!

### [Problem D2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2146/D2)

A problem involving binary representation, OR operation and maximization.

finished.

### [Problem E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2146/E)

A segment tree problem, requiring lazy tag & good design.

finished.
